## PRECIP 2022 Radars Scans in the Field for Realtime Monitoring

**Realtime CWB image. User-defined azimuth and range.**

* **This notebook pulls the CWB latest radar image from https://www.cwb.gov.tw/V8/C/W/OBS_Radar.html, and plot the scan azimuths from the planned S-Pol (Hsin-Chu) and SEA-POL (Yonaguni Isl.) radar locations.**

* **How to run?**
    1. Choose the radars (S-Pol at Hsin-Chu or SEA-POL at Yonaguni, or both)
    2. Specify the list of the scan azimuths and ranges.
    3. Check out the output figure of the scans.
    4. Repeat 2â€“3 to make final decision for the scan strategy.
